# GeoFS-GPWS-Alarms-and-Callouts
Most Credit goes to tylerbmusic for the original addon, I just made some edits to the addon and rename it.

Instructions:*
*To use, you must have the Google Chrome extention Tampermonkey.

1. Copy all the contents of the file named 'userscript.json'
2. Open the extention and click 'Create a new script'#
3. Paste the code that you copied earlier into the available box
4. Click Ctrl and S at the same time (when I say to click Ctrl and S, I mean the keys on you keyboard). Doing this saves the script.
5. Close the Tampermonkey tab.
6. Open GeoFS to test it out.

Known issues:*
*I don't know if these issues are issues for everyone or if it's just my Chromebook not wanting to work.

1. Sink Rate alarm doesn't work.
2. Overspeed alarm doesn't work.
If there are any more issues that I should know, please open the issue in https://github.com/tylerbmusic/GeoFS-GPWS-Callouts/issues. He made the actual code, I'll also open an issue tab on the same link for the issues listed above. When they are fixed, the userscript in this repository will be edited accordingly.

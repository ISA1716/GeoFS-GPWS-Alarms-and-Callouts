# GeoFS-GPWS-Alarms-and-Callouts
Most Credit goes to tylerbmusic for the original addon, I just made some edits to the addon and rename it.

Instructions:*
*To use, you must have the Google Chrome extention Tampermonkey.

1. Copy all the contents of the file named 'userscript.json'
2. Open the extention and click 'Create a new script'#
3. Paste the code that you copied earlier into the available box
4. Click Ctrl and S at the same time (when I say to click Ctrl and S, I mean the keys on you keyboard). Doing this saves the script.
5. Close the Tampermonkey tab.
6. Open GeoFS to test it out.
